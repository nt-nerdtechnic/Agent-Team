/**
 * A plugin surface must call `loadTheme()` with no arguments.
 *
 * `useTheme.loadTheme(backendFallback)` promotes the fallback into the shared
 * settings store when the store holds no local value (pinned by
 * useTheme.test.ts). A plugin surface mirrors that store back to the Host, so
 * a surface passing a fallback would write the theme back and the two would
 * take turns overriding each other. The symptom — host and guest flipping
 * themes — is very hard to trace to the one argument that caused it, and
 * adding that argument looks like a reasonable thing to do ("let the plugin
 * take a default theme from the backend too").
 *
 * Three barriers stand between that mistake and a live loop today: this
 * convention, `canWriteKey` refusing writes to keys a surface does not own,
 * and the entry-query seed making `fromLocal` true. Only the last two had
 * tests; this pins the first.
 *
 * `App.vue` is deliberately absent: it is the host document, it owns the
 * theme, and its `loadTheme({ theme, theme_custom })` at the project-load path
 * is the legitimate use this rule exists to distinguish from.
