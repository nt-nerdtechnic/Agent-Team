"""Where a `to:` target goes — the one answer, for every way of asking.

Two surfaces send messages between agents: the MCP tool ``cli_send``, and the
bare-line protocol an agent prints into its own terminal, which the window
routes through the ``agent_msg.route`` handler. They took the same strings and
gave different answers.

Cross-device addressing was built onto ``cli_send`` alone (8cca3aed: "cli_send
only ever reached panes on the same machine"), and the roster that resolves a
device *name* came later (a0358412). Neither touched the bare-line handler, and
nothing in either commit says that was a decision — so ``<device>/<ws>/<pane>``
worked from the tool and answered "unknown device" from a printed block, for the
same address, at the same moment. The error even said the roster was "not
available yet", written before the roster existed and never revisited.

So the resolution order lives here, once, and both callers use it. Keeping two
copies in step is not something anybody would notice failing: the paths agree
today and would drift on the next change to either.

Layering: ``agent_messaging`` is the pane registry and must not know about the
link (it imports only ``device_identity`` and ``remote_roster``). This module
sits above both, which is the position ``mcp_server.server`` already occupied.
