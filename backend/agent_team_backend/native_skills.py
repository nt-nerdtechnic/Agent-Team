"""Read-only reflection of the skills each CLI keeps in its own directory.

Users arrive with skills already installed where their CLIs look for them
(``~/.copilot/skills``, ``~/.claude/skills``, ...). Navide lists those so
they can be seen and delivered to *other* agents, but it never copies,
links, moves or edits them: this module has no write path at all, by
construction. Every call is a fresh scan; nothing is cached on disk.

Three rules the scan keeps:

- **Dedupe by real path.** The same skill is often reachable from several
  roots (``ego-browser`` is a link from ``.claude``, ``.agents`` and ``.grok``
  to one directory). ``resolve()`` is the identity; the first root that
  reaches it is the primary source, the others are recorded as aliases.
- **The shared root is not native.** ``~/.agents/skills`` is a discovery root
  for six CLIs, but Navide also *manages* it (see ``SkillsStore``), so a scan
  excludes it — otherwise a managed skill would surface twice, once editable
  and once read-only.
- **A native skill is never delivered to its own agent.** That agent already
  reads it from where it is; delivering it again would double it up.
