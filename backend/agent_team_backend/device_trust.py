"""Which trust ring a remote device sits in, and who knocked and was refused.

``pane_policy`` answers one question well: does this receiver's rule set let
that sender drive that pane. It is allow-only on purpose — with no deny rules
there is no precedence to argue about — and that design is worth keeping. But
it leaves two things unsaid, and both of them are structure rather than rules:

*Which ring is the sender in.* Signing one account in on a second machine is
itself the grant, exactly as joining a tailnet is, so your own devices never
consult the rules at all. Until now that lived as one ``==`` in the middle of
the delivery path, which is a poor place for a trust boundary: nothing named
it, nothing tested it as a concept, and the next person to touch that function
had no reason to know it was load-bearing.

*How to refuse a device outright.* An allow-only rule set cannot say "not this
one, ever". You can decline to grant, but you cannot revoke reach from a
machine that some broader rule already covers — and the case that needs it is
the sharp one: a laptop of your own that walked off. That is why ``blocked`` is
checked **before** the own-device shortcut. Blocking cannot lock you out of the
machine you are sitting at: the local device is never a remote sender.

The third gap is not authorization but *observation*. A denied message today
fails silently — the sender is told, and the person whose machine refused it is
told nothing. RustDesk's model is built the other way round: the refusing side
is the side that sees the request and decides. ``AccessRequests`` below is that
surface. It is deliberately not a second authorization system: approving a
request writes an ordinary ``pane_policy`` allow rule, so there stays exactly
one place where "may this sender drive this pane" is answered.

Storage: both the block list and the rules live in the same receiver-authored
policy document, which the server stores verbatim and never interprets. The
document stays at ``version: 1`` — a bump would make every older build
fail-closed and lock its owner out of their own network. ``blocked`` is an
optional field an older build ignores, so an un-upgraded machine keeps exactly
today's behaviour and a new one is strictly stricter. That direction is the
only safe one for a field that takes reach away.
