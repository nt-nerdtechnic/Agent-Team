"""Panes on *other* devices, as Navide-Server last described them.

``agent_messaging`` is this machine's roster: every window mirrors its panes
there and the backend owns their addressing. This module is the other half —
the sessions Navide-Server reports for every *other* device in the team space.
Without it a `<device>/<workspace>/<pane>` address is only usable by someone who
already knows the target device's id by heart, which is to say the whole
cross-device path is unreachable for an agent.

It is a cache of what the server said, never a source of truth. ``server_link``
is the only writer: it fills this from ``sessions.directory`` once per
connection and then from the ``sessions.changed`` push, both of which carry the
*whole* directory, so every write is a wholesale replace rather than a diff
this module would have to get right.

**Empty is the normal state.** A machine with no server configured never
receives a single entry, so every read here answers "no remote panes" and the
on-machine paths behave exactly as they did before cross-device addressing
existed.

**The cache survives a disconnect**, deliberately, the same way ``server_link``
keeps the pane policy across one: a link that dropped a second ago does not make
the panes it knew about stop existing, and forgetting them would turn every
reconnect into a window where an agent is told the device it was just talking to
is unknown.
