"""PaneRecord.origin: the 'mcp' value and the four non-pipeline filters.

Before this suite, every filter that meant "not a pipeline pane" was written
as `origin == "manual"`. Adding a third origin value silently broke all four
of them, and no existing test covered a non-"manual" non-pipeline record — so
the breakage would have passed CI. These tests pin the `!= "pipeline"` intent.
