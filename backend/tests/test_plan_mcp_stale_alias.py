"""A CLI keeps the pane id its /plan-mcp URL was built with, forever.

The URL is written once, when the pane spawns. Rebuilding the pane around the
same running CLI — a window reload, a detach, a run group coming back from a
detached window — mints a new pane id and leaves that URL pointing at the old
one, which used to fail every tool on the endpoint (plan_create included, since
a pane's own workspace is what those default to).

The window now tells the backend where the old id went, so these tests are about
one thing: the caller is resolved to the pane its process is attached to, and
every check downstream is made against that pane's current identity.
