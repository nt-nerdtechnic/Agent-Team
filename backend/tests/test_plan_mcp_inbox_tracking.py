"""cli_inbox_summary's empty answer had no meaning.

The send-status table is process memory: an hour, a few hundred sends, gone on
restart. cli_inbox_summary reports only what is stale or failed, so `messages:
[]` was returned by two situations a caller has to tell apart — "nothing of
yours is stuck" and "this backend restarted under you and every msg_key you are
holding is now unknown". An orchestrator two hours into a run, having survived
a restart it never saw, reads the empty list as everything-fine and never learns
that it can no longer say whether its work was delivered.

cli_check_message already answers an unknown key with "not tracked any more".
These give the summary the same honesty, without making the table durable —
the comment above `_MESSAGE_STATUS_MAX` explains why the outcomes live and die
with the process, and that decision stands.
