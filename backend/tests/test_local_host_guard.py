"""Tests for the loopback boundary: Host allowlist, schema routes, /health.

A DNS-rebinding page makes itself same-origin with 127.0.0.1 and can then read
our responses — which is what turns an unauthenticated `/fs/raw` into a way to
read the ws token off disk. It cannot forge Host, so refusing a request whose
Host is not this server is what closes that path. These tests pin the three
things that go wrong quietly: a foreign Host getting through, a real caller
being refused, and the guard not reaching routes plugins append at startup.
