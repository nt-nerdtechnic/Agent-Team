"""The bidirectional tools composed, rather than each proven alone.

Every tool here has its own unit tests. This asks the different question the
audit was about: do they make the round trip that was missing — one agent
sending, the other reading and answering, either side able to take it back or
learn who is waiting?

Written after a hand-run smoke script found a real defect the unit suites
could not: the three-language docs described cli_whoami's answer as nested
under a `you` key, while the tool answers flat. Nothing compared the two, so
nothing went red. The shape assertions below are that comparison.
