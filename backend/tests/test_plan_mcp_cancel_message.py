"""cli_cancel_message: taking back a message that has not gone in yet.

The channel already existed for the Messages panel; this is the MCP face of
it. What needs testing is the accounting: a withdrawal must not be recorded as
a failure, being too late must be reported as what actually happened, and a
window that never answers must not let the caller believe the message is gone.
