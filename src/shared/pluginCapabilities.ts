// Single source of truth for what the bundled plugins require.
//
// The same capability list has to appear in three places that are built and
// loaded independently, and nothing used to tie them together:
//
//   1. the packaged manifest    — vite.<plugin>.config.ts emitManifest()
//   2. the dev descriptor       — frontendPluginManager devXPluginDescriptor()
//   3. the plugin's WS-type map — plugins/<plugin>/capabilityBackend TYPE_TO_CAP
//
// Drift between 1 and 2 makes a dev run deny calls the packaged build allows
// (or the reverse), which only shows up when someone runs the other build.
// Drift against 3 is caught by each plugin's capabilityBackend test, which
// asserts the namespaces it maps against the set below.
//
// A plugin may declare MORE than its map uses (navide.plans declares `plans`
// without mapping any plans.* WS type yet) — a superset is safe. The unsafe
// direction is a map reaching a namespace the manifest never granted, which
// the broker would deny at runtime.
