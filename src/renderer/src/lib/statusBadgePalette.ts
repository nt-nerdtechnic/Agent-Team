/** The colour vocabulary a pane status can be painted with, and which colour
 *  each status starts out as.
 *
 *  Status colours used to live only as `[data-status='x']` CSS rules, once per
 *  surface — the pane pill, the sidebar dot, the meeting badge and the resource
 *  row each restated the same hue. That made a status impossible to recolour
 *  without editing five files, and it is why 'stopped' still carried a literal
 *  #000000 while every other status went through a token.
 *
 *  The CSS rules stay (they are the default look, and a surface with no rule
 *  silently falls back to neutral grey — see statusBadgeCss.test.ts). What is
 *  new is an override layer: a surface paints `var(--status-badge-bg, <its own
 *  default>)`, and a customized status supplies that variable inline. No
 *  customization, no variable, and the default rule wins untouched.
 *
 *  Every entry resolves through theme tokens rather than fixed hex, so a colour
 *  chosen once stays legible in light, dark, midnight, forest and high-contrast.

 *
 *  The shipped values and the per-surface CSS say the same thing, and have to
 *  be changed together: this table is what the picker shows as "current" and
 *  what "Reset" clears back to, while the CSS is what actually paints.
 *
 *  'starting' and 'idle' paint through a role token (`--status-starting-*`,
 *  `--status-idle-*`) rather than a colour family directly, so a theme whose
 *  family colour would collide with another status can move that one status
 *  alone. That is also why the picker's `blue` swatch above resolves through
 *  `--status-idle-*`: it is the entry that has to stay blue in dark-forest,
 *  where `--accent-*` is green.
 *
 *  'stopped' and 'disconnected' are `ink` — near-black in dark themes, a pale
 *  inset in light ones. That replaced a literal `#000000` on white text, which
 *  read as a hole punched in the light theme.
