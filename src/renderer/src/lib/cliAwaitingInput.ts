// Deciding whether a CLI pane is parked on the user — blocked on a permission
// prompt or a question — as opposed to having finished its turn. The two look
// identical on the PTY: a prompt paints once and then goes silent, exactly
// like a turn that ended, so the RUNNING/idle heuristic cannot separate them
// and needs an out-of-band signal.
//
// There are two such signals, and which one a pane gets depends on its vendor:
//   • A notification hook we install, whose payload names the situation. This
//     is authoritative and is what claude/qwen/copilot use.
//   • Otherwise the prompt is recognized from the text it paints — the vendor
//     declares the shape in its `awaitingInput` spec (see agents/types.ts).
//
// Where each CLI stands, and why (surveyed 2026-08-08):
//
//   claude    hook   Notification, ~/.claude/settings.json
//   qwen      hook   Notification, ~/.qwen/settings.json (Claude's schema)
//   copilot   hook   notification, ~/.copilot/hooks/*.json (own file)
//   codex     text   Has a PermissionRequest hook, deliberately unused: Codex
//                    gates new hooks behind a trust screen the user must clear
//                    per pane, and again on every change to the hook file.
//   aider     text   No hook system at all. Its --notifications-command fires
//                    identically for "waiting" and "turn ended" and carries no
//                    payload, so it cannot answer the question.
//   kimi      —      Has PermissionRequest/PermissionResult hooks, but they
//                    fire only when an approval RPC surface exists, unverified
//                    for the TUI, and the payload's outer envelope (where a
//                    session id would live) was never confirmed. Attribution
//                    would fail silently.
//   opencode  —      Best mechanism of any of them (permission.updated over
//                    an SSE /event stream) but it needs the pane spawned with
//                    `--port`: without one the TUI serves no HTTP listener.
//                    Its on-screen strings are i18n keys, so text is out too.
//   kilo      —      An opencode fork; same story, and not installed here.
//   cursor    —      No permission event. Its beforeShellExecution hook is a
//                    synchronous gate — using it would make Navide part of the
//                    approval decision, not an observer of it.
//   antigravity text Hook docs unpublished, and no permission event. Its
//                    ask_question box is matched from the screen instead —
//                    a second route to the QUESTION its reader already raises
//                    from step_type 138, which needs marker binding first and
//                    reports nothing while that is pending. The permission box
//                    is still unmatched: its strings are in the binary but in
//                    none of the PTY captures, since Navide launches past it.
//   grok      —      Hooks exist but carry no permission event; its
//                    Notification is for background delegations. The TUI is
//                    compiled to bytecode, so no strings to match either.
//   muse      —      No hook system and no permission record in its log.
//   pi        —      Documented as deliberately having no permission prompts.
//                    It never stops to ask, so the state does not exist.
