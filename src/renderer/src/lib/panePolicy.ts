//   * it is **deny by default with allow-only rules**, so an empty document is

//   * every field is two-state — an exact value or `*` — never a pattern, so a
//     rule is something a person can verify by reading it.
//
// The server stores the document verbatim and never merges, so an edit is
// always "read the whole thing, change it, write the whole thing back".
