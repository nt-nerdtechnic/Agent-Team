  // recorded this as silently swallowed; that was wrong. What it saw was
  // opencode REJECTING the value (unknown provider, or an id missing its
  // `provider/` prefix) through a three-second toast. Values must therefore
  // be `provider/model` within a provider the user has configured;
  // `opencode models` lists what that resolves to. Effort is not a flag here
  // either — it is part of the model id (`-high`, `-fast`) or a config
  // variant.

  //
  // `--auto` was declared here once on the claim that an older build ignores an
  // unknown root flag, "verified" with `opencode --auto --version`. That probe
  // proves nothing: `--version` short-circuits inside yargs before unknown
  // arguments are ever checked. Re-measured on 1.15.12 without it, the root
  // command REJECTS the flag — `opencode --auto models` prints the help banner
  // and exits 1, while bare `opencode models` exits 0 — so a YOLO-mode pane
  // spawned `opencode --auto ...`, never reached the TUI, and died on startup.
  // id is `ses_`-prefixed.
