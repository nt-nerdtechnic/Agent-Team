  // would resume a session named after the level, so both are refused.
  // Droid has no boolean "skip every prompt" flag on its INTERACTIVE command:
  // `droid --help` (0.204.0) lists only `--auto <level>` with low|medium|high.
  // `--skip-permissions-unsafe` exists, but `droid exec --help` is the only
  // place that documents it, and the interactive binary silently ignores
  // unknown flags (verified: a deliberately bogus flag still starts the TUI),
  // so "it did not error" proves nothing here. `--auto high` is the documented
  // unattended level and is what YOLO mode appends.

  // in one workspace would be indistinguishable. The kickoff marker is what
  // separates them, exactly as it does for the other markered vendors.
