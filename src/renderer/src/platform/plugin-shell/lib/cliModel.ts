/**
 * cliModel.ts
 *
 * One definition of how a launch command names the model to run.
 *
 * `modelArgsFor` answers both questions a caller has — "may this vendor be
 * told which model to use?" and "what does that look like on the command
 * line?" — from the same branch, so a refusal and the argv can never
 * disagree. Every spawn, resume and restore path must go through it, for the
 * reason spelled out in cliPermission.ts: a flag inlined at one call site
 * takes effect on some paths and not others.
 *
 * Values are also shape-checked before they reach a command line. A model id
 * is data, not syntax: it cannot contain whitespace and cannot begin with a
 * dash, or `--model "sonnet --dangerously-skip-permissions"` would split into
 * three arguments and hand the spawn an extra flag. This is NOT the identity
 * check the comment on modelArgsFor rules out — it never asks whether an id
 * exists, only whether the string can turn into a second argument, so it
 * cannot go stale when a vendor renames its models.
 *
 * A vendor that cannot select a model at launch declares no `modelArgs`, and
 * asking one for a model is refused rather than dropped. That is deliberate:
 * droid and opencode accept an unknown `--model` on their interactive command
 * and ignore it, so a silently discarded flag looks exactly like a working
 * one until someone reads the transcript and finds the wrong model answered.
