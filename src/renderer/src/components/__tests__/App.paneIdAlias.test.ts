// parse the source text instead, guarding one wiring rule: every path that
// rebuilds a pane around a CLI that never stopped running must tell the backend
// which pane id that CLI was reached under before, or the id baked into its
// /plan-mcp URL at spawn time stops resolving and every MCP tool fails for it.
// The backend half (alias registry, chain flattening, what still gets refused)
// is covered in backend/tests/test_agent_messaging_alias.py.
