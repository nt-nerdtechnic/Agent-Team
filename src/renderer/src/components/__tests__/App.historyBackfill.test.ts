// Restore rebuilds history rows for panes that were closed before the app last
// quit. It used to stamp both timestamps with project.updated_at, which is
// rewritten on every save — so the whole batch arrived carrying roughly the
// app's start time and piled into "Today", and the entries claimed to have
// been removed at a moment nothing happened. It also hard-coded origin
// 'manual', which mislabelled every mcp-spawned session.
//
// The behaviour of the resulting rows is covered in spawnHistory.test.ts and
// AgentHistoryModal.refresh.test.ts; what is only assertable here is the shape
// of the record restore writes, because App.vue cannot be mounted (backend and
// terminal lifecycles start on mount) and the backfill is inline in restore.
// These are source assertions and no stronger than that.
