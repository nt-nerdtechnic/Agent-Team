// Starting a workspace fresh was the one restore batch nothing capped.

// Three ceilings exist and all three missed it at once: the scope setting is
// skipped for a fresh start (it takes the whole pending list), the
// all-scope concurrency limit is conditioned on the decision being 'resume',
// and the resume semaphore in useTerminal only engages when isResume is true —
// which a fresh spawn, by definition, is not. A twenty-pane workspace opened
// with "Never" sent twenty terminal.create at once.
//
// Source-scanned, like the other App.*.test.ts files: App.vue cannot be
// mounted, since backend and terminal lifecycles start on mount.
