// A machine is asking to pair. This is what somebody actually sees.

// stays — it is the record, and the way back in if this was dismissed. But it
// is five sections down a window nobody has open, and a request that expires in
// five minutes cannot wait for somebody to go looking. So it comes to them.
//
// Both ends get one. It served the responder alone, back when the initiator did
// not confirm at all — pressing "Pair with…" was its whole answer. Both confirm
// now, because the six digits are the only part of the exchange a relay cannot
// produce and somebody has to compare them at each end; and the reason the
// responder needed a popup applies unchanged to the initiator, whose account
// window may be closed or scrolled elsewhere while the one button that finishes
// the exchange waits in it.
//
// It also acknowledges the press. "Pair" used to produce nothing until the far
// machine answered, which is seconds of a button that has visibly done nothing.
//
// Every press has to change something on screen. The first version sent the
// answer and waited for the list to stop containing the request — so a person
// who pressed Allow saw a button dim and nothing else, and a backend that
// answered with an error was indistinguishable from one that answered at all.
// Pressing now moves through three visible states: in flight, settled, gone.
